            <p className="font-bold">
              IA TOKEN IS A COMMUNITY MEMBERSHIP TOKEN ONLY. IT IS NOT AN INVESTMENT OF ANY KIND. IT IS NOT A SECURITY, COMMODITY, SWAP, DERIVATIVE, OR ANY OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is absolutely no expectation of profit, financial return, or appreciation in value. You should assume that any funds used to acquire IA tokens will be lost entirely and permanently. Do not acquire IA tokens if you cannot afford to lose 100% of your funds.
            </p>
            <p>
              IA tokens have no inherent value. Any market price is purely speculative and determined by third-party markets over which we have no control. We make no representations about current or future value.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-6">1.2 No Promises, Guarantees, or Representations</h3>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground">3. The IA Token</h2>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-6">3.1 Community Token</h3>
            <p>
              IA is a community membership token deployed on blockchain networks. It exists solely for community participation purposes. We do not control the blockchain networks on which IA operates.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-6">3.2 Token Burns</h3>
            <p>
              The IA token smart contract includes an automatic burn mechanism that destroys a percentage of tokens on each transfer. This reduces the total supply over time. We make no representations about the effect of burns on token value. Burns do not create any expectation of profit or price appreciation.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-6">3.3 No Control Over Blockchain</h3>
            <p>
              Blockchain transactions are irreversible once confirmed. We have absolutely no ability to reverse, cancel, modify, or recover any blockchain transaction. We are not responsible for any errors, including but not limited to:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Sending tokens to incorrect addresses</li>
              <li>Sending tokens to incompatible networks</li>
              <li>Failed transactions due to network conditions</li>
              <li>Transactions with incorrect parameters</li>
              <li>Loss due to smart contract bugs or exploits</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-6">3.4 Smart Contract Risks</h3>
            <p>
              Smart contracts are experimental technology. The IA token smart contract may contain bugs, vulnerabilities, or errors that could result in loss of funds. Smart contracts cannot be modified after deployment. You acknowledge these risks and accept sole responsibility.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-6">3.5 Self-Custody</h3>
            <p>
              You are solely responsible for the security of your wallet, private keys, and seed phrases. We never have custody or control of your tokens or keys. If you lose access to your wallet, we cannot recover your tokens under any circumstances.
            </p>
            <p>
              Never share your private keys or seed phrase with anyone, including anyone claiming to represent IA Community.
